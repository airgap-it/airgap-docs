Staking is a way to earn rewards by holding certain cryptocurrencies. It works through a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake, which puts your crypto to work to verify and secure transactions. Only some cryptocurrencies allow staking, and this is because they use a different consensus mechanism than those that do not. Staking offers advantages such as generating rewards and contributing to the security and efficiency of the blockchain. However, there are also risks such as lockup periods, slashing and the need for technical knowledge. AirGap allows users to participate in staking in a secure manner without needing any technical knowledge or purchasing or operating expensive validator hardware.
