## Introduction to Optimism Blockchain

Optimism is a layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum blockchain that aims to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees. It is designed to enhance the usability and efficiency of decentralized applications (DApps) by providing fast and low-cost transactions.

The Optimism blockchain leverages a technology known as Optimistic Rollup, which allows for the execution of smart contracts off-chain while maintaining a high level of security. By batching multiple transactions into a single transaction, Optimism significantly increases the throughput of the Ethereum network, enabling more DApps to operate seamlessly.

### AirGap Optimism Wallet
