This guide is for those who already have AirGap set up. If you are new to AirGap, follow [this](https://medium.com/airgap-it/airgap-set-up-guide-861e0f4b39b6) guide to set up your AirGap Wallet.

Make sure you have already linked your Tezos account from AirGap Vault to AirGap Wallet.

Make sure you are already delegated else staking will be not be possible. To learn how to delegate on Tezos please follow [this](/currencies/tezos/delegate-xtz.mdx) guide.

1. Open AirGap Wallet and Select Tezos.

3. From the Staking Menu, enter the amount that you want to stake. Then, tap on the “Stake” button.
   The image below may appear different for you, depending on the staking operation you've performed or not performed previously. The unstake tab will only appear after you've staked, while the finalize tab will appear four cycles after you unstaked. A cycle on the Tezos blockchain is approximately 2.83 days so four cycles will be around 11.28 days (about 1 and a half weeks).

8. In case you need to unstake your XTZ for some reason, you can do that by going to the Unstake Menu. Just enter the amount you want to Unstake and Hit “Unstake”.

Unstaking follows the process as staking. Click the unstake button > sign in the Vault > broadcast the transaction in the wallet.

You can claim (finalize) your reward and stake 4 cycles after unstaking .
