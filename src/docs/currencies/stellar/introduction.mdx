## Introduction to Stellar

Stellar is an open-source blockchain network designed to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border payments and asset transfers. Launched in 2014 by Jed McCaleb, co-founder of Ripple, Stellar aims to connect financial systems and enable people to move money quickly and reliably across borders, using its native currency Lumens (XLM) as a bridge. The network supports tokenization of any asset—from fiat currencies to commodities—making it ideal for remittances and global trade. With built-in smart contract capabilities and near-instant transaction finality, Stellar is increasingly used by fintech platforms, banks, and even governments looking to modernize financial infrastructure.
Stellar offers a flexible multi-signature system where any account can be converted to a multi-sig account by adding one or more signers with assigned weights. Unlike other blockchains, this setup is dynamic — users can modify signer weights or remove signers entirely to revert back to a single-signature account. This makes Stellar’s multi-sig model highly adaptable for both individual and shared account control.
