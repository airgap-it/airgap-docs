[AirGap](https://airgap.it) is a non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet that lets you secure your crypto assets offline. It achieves this by using two apps, called AirGap Vault and AirGap Wallet.

The [AirGap Vault](airgap-vault/introduction) is responsible for secure secret recovery phrase generation and storage, as well as air-gapped transaction signing through QR codes. The Vault is installed on a dedicated device with no network connection, thereby protecting your secret recovery phrase from attackers.
Even if you choose to install the Vault on a device with network connectivity, the Vault application still stays offline.

The [AirGap Wallet](airgap-wallet/introduction) creates transactions, broadcasts transactions and shows a portfolio overview. The Wallet is installed on your everyday smartphone with network access. The wallet stores public information. The secret recovery phrase is only stored and used in the AirGap Vault, which does not have access to the internet at any time, thus making it inherently more secure than your regular software wallet with internet access.
