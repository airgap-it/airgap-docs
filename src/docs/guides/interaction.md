## Changing interaction settings

Some of our users use AirGap on a single device and later want to switch to two devices or vice versa. In this guide, we walk you through how to switch over to a different interaction approach in your AirGap Vault.

Go to the Vault.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/switching/switching0.jpg"} />

Go to the settings Tab.

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/switching/switching1.jpg"} />

Select the interaction settings. 

<IPhoneWrapper src={"/img/switching/switching2.jpg"} />

### Select your preferred mode of interaction. 

#### Always ask: 

This mode is suitable if you use the Vault on both single and two-device approaches. For instance, you are using the Vault with the AirGap wallet and also using it with MetaMask to access EVM chains not supported by the Wallet.

#### Vault is an offline device:

This mode is suitable if you are using a two-device approach. For instance, you are using the Vault and Wallet on two devices or paired the Vault with other wallets like MetaMask, Sparrow, Blue, or any other QR-based wallet.

#### Vault and Wallet on the Same Phone: 

This mode should be used if you have both the Vault and the Wallet on the same device.
