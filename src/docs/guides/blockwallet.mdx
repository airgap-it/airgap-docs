3. Now, backup this account. This recovery phrase is not linked to your AirGap account anyhow. If you want to backup your recovery phrase, you can use AirGap's metal [recovery plates](https://shop.airgap.it/product-category/metal-plate/). Made up of steel, these plates are fireproof and waterproof so you don't have to worry about your seed phrase ever.
