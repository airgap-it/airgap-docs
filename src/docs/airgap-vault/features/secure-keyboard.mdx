Some keyboards record all the data that is entered and send it to a server. This is done for spell checking or to train the keyboard to give you better suggestions. To eliminate the risk of leaking your mnemonic through your keyboard, we built a secure in-app keyboard with no dependencies on third parties.

### Advantages of the secure keyboard

- The keyboard cannot record/save your mnemonic (some device keyboards do this for spell checking and send what you type to a server - this is not safe). Our in-app keyboard does not connect to any network or rely on external dependencies.
- There is a "scramble" button that shuffles the order of the letters on the keyboard, which improves the security if someone is watching over your shoulder.
- The keyboard allows only valid words from the BIP39 list to be entered. So there can be no more typos, double spaces, etc.
- The keyboard has BIP39 words autocomplete for faster imports. It reduces the time it takes to type all 24 words.
- There is a “hide” button that masks the mnemonic that you already entered, improving the security if someone watches over your shoulder.
