title: Recommended Devices To Run AirGap Vault

AirGap Vault should be run on a dedicated device that is fully air-gapped, meaning it is not and never will be connected to any network. The app can be installed on a variety of devices. This flexibility is one of the strengths of AirGap Vault, because there is no vendor lock-in to any device and users can choose devices according to their preferences.

We generally recommend to use an old phone that is no longer in use. In case someone has to buy a dedicated device, there are a couple of considerations:

- Trust in Hardware Vendor
- Security of the device
- Price
- Ergonomics
- Software Compatibility
- Users' Technical Skill

## Recommended Devices

:::warning
While we have reviewed the devices that are recommended here, the vendor ultimately has full control over them, so make sure you trust the vendor.
