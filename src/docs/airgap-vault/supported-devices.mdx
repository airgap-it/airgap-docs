## Desktop / Laptop

:::warning Desktop
Do not run AirGap Vault on your Windows/Mac/Linux PC, unless it is fully air-gapped and you know what you are doing. AirGap Vault relies on some mobile specific features (eg. Secure Storage and Biometrics) to secure your mnemonic. On desktop these security features are not available, so it _needs_ to be run on an air-gapped device and encrypt / wipe all data after usage.

| Device / OS | Works | Details |
| ----------- | :---: | ------- |
| Ubuntu 20   |  ✅   |         |
| Tails       |   ?   |         |

:::tip Desktop
Desktop PCs often don't have built in WiFi chips, so they can easily be air-gapped.
